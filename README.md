#### Note:
I worked at a startup that has lots of bad reviews. I no longer work there but before I left I was able to convince the team to use BackboneJS. Everyone agreed. Their lead front-end developer loved Foundation and he decided to include that too. A long time has passed and their site is still the same so here I am putting this on Github in hopes of helping them. This might even help the sad designer who's claim to fame is creating bookmarks in Chrome and using a blog that looks like it's from 1999. I can't give you talent so stop asking. I don't owe you anything. I get requests for coding 'tests' (or free work?) occassionally so this might help with that too.
